MasterCut
=====

###Abstract:  
My research project will be to develop a small, Bluetooth enabled device and companion mobile app that keeps track of the progress of a HEMA fighter from match to match.  This data, along with an achievement-based reward system, will be used to see if utilizing gamification will motivate fighters to improve more than non-monitored sparring.

###Background:  
Gamification is the concept of taking traditional game design concepts (such as achievements, leaderboards, competition / co-operation), and applying them to things other than games.  It is a new field, but preliminary results from its application appear very promising.  Many industries that typically have nothing to do with gaming, such as the fitness or education industry, have recently used gamification concepts with mixed, but generally positive results.  The question now with the idea of gamification isn’t necessarily if it works, but how best to apply it to a given application.

The application I am choosing to try is HEMA, or Historical European Martial Arts.  HEMA is the modern-day revival of 15th century medieval martial arts, and differentiates itself from traditional eastern martial arts in several ways.  Primarily, it is set apart by its choice of weapon systems and historical texts, but most important to this study, by placing a heavy emphasis on full-speed, full-contact sparring and tournament fighting.  As it a sport that requires constant learning and improvement, it is the perfect candidate from gamification.

To this end, my objective will be to create two prototypes that I am collectively calling Mastercut (after a technique taught in HEMA):  a small, durable, Bluetooth-enabled device, and a companion mobile app.  This system will utilize gamification techniques in order to help fighters improve in casual and competitive sparring.  The device will consist of three buttons that, when pressed, will tell the mobile app what the results of a sparring match were:  Win, loss, or double (draw).  The mobile app will use this information to keep track of the fighter’s win / loss percentage on a weekly basis with a given weapon system, and also award achievements based on performance.

Of course, these are only basic prototypes to demonstrate if the gamification theory works as an application for HEMA, and if the system has any merit and appeal to fighters.
